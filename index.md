## Welcome to Wenzhuo Huang's homepage!

I am currently a 3rd year PhD candidate in [Prof. Ertugrul Cubukcu's group](http://cubukcu.ucsd.edu/Cubukcu_Lab-UCSD/Home.html). My research interest lies in the field of nanophotonics, especially the interaction between 2D materials and photonic nanostructure.
