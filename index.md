I am currently a 6th year PhD candidate in Photonics, Electrical and Computer Engineerning at University of California, San Diego. I am working with Prof. Ertugrul Cubukcu in [Nanoengineered Photonics Group](http://cubukcu.ucsd.edu/Cubukcu_Lab-UCSD/Home.html). Our research motivation is to study light-matter interaction using novel nanoscale devices and sensors.
