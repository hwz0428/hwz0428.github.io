## Research

![](/Images/enhmap_flw.png)

My research interest lies in the field of nanophotonics, including plasmonics, metamaterials, photonic crystals, 2D materials, exciton-polaritons, and most recently, topological photonics. More specifically, a few topics I am currently working on include: 
- Scattering and waveguiding in photonic crystals with non-Hermiticity and special symmetries.
- Directional enhancement of photoluminescence from 2D-semiconductors-integrated nano-devices.
- Exciton-polaritons and valleytronics in mono- and few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).
- Tunable topological photonic nanosctructures and edge states.

Some previous projects:
- Unidirectional surface plasmon polariton (SPP) antenna pair.
- Electrostatic tuning of plasmonic metamaterial cavity.
- Opto-mechanical cantilever based on plasmonic metamaterial absorber.
