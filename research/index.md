## Research

![](/Images/enhmap_flw.png)

My research interests lie in the field of nanophotonics, including plasmonics, metamaterials, photonic crystals, 2D materials, exciton-polaritons, and most recently, topological photonics. More specifically, a few projects I am working on include: 
- Scattering and waveguiding in photonic crystals with non-Hermiticity and special symmetries.
- Controlling photoluminescence from 2D semiconductors.
- Exciton-polaritons and valleytronics in mono- and few-layer TMDCs.
- Tunable topological photonic nanosctructures.
